CGPA Calculation:
To calculate the CGPA, sum the product of each course's grade point and its corresponding credit, and divide by the total number of credits (20).

Formula:
CGPA = ((G1 × C1) + (G2 × C2) + ... + (Gn × Cn)) / Total Credits
Where G1, G2, ..., Gn are the grade points (4.0 for A, 3.7 for A-, etc.) and C1, C2, ..., Cn are the course credits.
